## Project Overview
In the realm of AI, significant advancements have been achieved in developing large language models (LLMs) catering to various domains, including human healthcare. However, the domain of veterinary science has often been overlooked, resulting in limitations in the scope, efficacy, or availability of existing AI models for animal healthcare.

To address this gap, our project focuses on:

- **Dataset Collection**: We collected a novel veterinary medicine dataset named VetMed, comprising 500GB of training data sourced from reputable sources such as Wikipedia and ArXiv. This dataset includes over 56,000 question-answer and multiple-choice-question-answer pairs.

- **Model Development**: We developed a novel generative pre-trained transformer, VetMedGPT, specifically tailored for veterinary medicine healthcare. This model is fine-tuned and tested on the VetMed dataset to enhance its effectiveness in animal health diagnosis and care.
